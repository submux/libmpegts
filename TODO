libmpegts TODO list

Most important TODO is to get streams verified with a good analyzer
Is there a need to implement full T-STD modelling or use the simpler version currently implemented?
Do we need to control EB buffer fullness more?
Find out why some streams where muxrate is larger than TB leak rate fail to mux.
A true VBR mode? How to implement? Within Spec?
Write ATSC PSIP
Write DVB Tables (SIT, NIT, EIT) etc
Sort out T-STD on Data streams
Add more formats
Add Blu-ray formats - dealing with vbr audio?
